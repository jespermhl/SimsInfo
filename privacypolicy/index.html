               <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
               <p>This website is operated by: Jesper Mahel</p>
               <p>
                  It is very important to us to handle our website visitors'
                  data confidentially and to protect it in the best possible
                  way. For this reason, we make every effort to meet the
                  requirements of the GDPR.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Below we explain how we process your data on our website. We
                  use language that is as clear and transparent as possible so
                  that you really understand what happens to your data.
               </p>
               <h2>2. General Information</h2>
               <p><b>2.1 Processing of personal data and other terms</b></p>
               <p>
                  Data protection applies to the processing of personal data.
                  Personal data means all data with which you can be personally
                  identified. This is, for example, the IP address of the device
                  (PC, laptop, smartphone, etc.) you are currently sitting in
                  front of. Such data is processed when 'something happens to
                  it'. Here, for example, the IP is transmitted from the browser
                  to our provider and automatically stored there. This is then a
                  processing (according to
                  Art.&nbsp;4&nbsp;No.&nbsp;2&nbsp;GDPR) of personal data
                  (according to Art.&nbsp;4&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1&nbsp;GDPR).
               </p>
               <p>
                  These and other legal definitions can be found in
                  Art.&nbsp;4&nbsp;GDPR.
               </p>
               <br />
               <p>
                  <b>2.2 Applicable regulations/laws - GDPR, BDSG and TTDSG</b>
               </p>
               <p>
                  The scope of data protection is regulated by law. In this
                  case, these are the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
                  as a European regulation and the BDSG (Federal Data Protection
                  Act) as a national law.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In addition, the TTDSG supplements the provisions of the GDPR
                  as far as the use of cookies is concerned.
               </p>
               <br />
               <p><b>2.3 The person in charge</b></p>
               <p>
                  The controller within the meaning of the GDPR is responsible
                  for data processing on this website. This is the natural or
                  legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the
                  purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
               </p>
               <p>You can reach the person responsible at:</p>
               <p>

               <br />
               <p><b>2.4 How data is generally processed on this website</b></p>
               <p>
                  As we have already established, some data (e.g. IP address) is
                  collected automatically. This data is mainly required for the
                  technical provision of the website. If we also use personal
                  data or collect other data, we will inform you of this or ask
                  for your consent.
               </p>
               <p>You consciously provide us with other personal data.</p>
               <p>You will find detailed information on this below.</p>
               <br />
               <p><b>2.5 Your rights</b></p>
               <p>
                  The GDPR provides you with comprehensive rights. These
                  include, for example, free information about the origin,
                  recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You can
                  also request the rectification, blocking or erasure of this
                  data or lodge a complaint with the competent data protection
                  supervisory authority. You can revoke your consent at any
                  time.
               </p>
               <p>
                  You can find out what these rights look like in detail and how
                  to exercise them in the last section of this privacy policy.
               </p>
               <br />
               <p><b>2.6 Data protection - Our point of view</b></p>
               <p>
                  Data protection is more than just a chore for us! Personal
                  data has great value and careful handling of this data should
                  be a matter of course in our digitalized world. As a website
                  visitor, you should also be able to decide for yourself what
                  "happens" to your data, when and by whom. That is why we are
                  committed to complying with all legal regulations, only
                  collect the data that is necessary for us and, of course,
                  treat it confidentially.
               </p>
               <br />
               <p><b>2.7 Forwarding and deletion</b></p>
               <p>
                  The transfer and deletion of data are also important and
                  sensitive issues. We would therefore like to briefly inform
                  you in advance about our general approach to this.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Data will only be passed on on the basis of a legal basis and
                  only if this is unavoidable. This may be the case in
                  particular if it is a so-called processor and an order
                  processing contract has been concluded in accordance with
                  Art.&nbsp;28&nbsp;GDPR.
               </p>
               <p>
                  We delete your data when the purpose and legal basis for
                  processing no longer apply and the deletion does not conflict
                  with any other legal obligations. Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;GDPR also
                  provides a 'good' overview of this.
               </p>
               <p>
                  For further information, please refer to this privacy policy
                  and contact the person responsible if you have any specific
                  questions.
               </p>

               <p><b>2.8 Hosting</b></p>
               <p>
                  This website is hosted externally. The personal data collected
                  on this website is stored on the host's servers. This includes
                  the automatically collected and stored log files (see below
                  for more details), as well as all other data provided by
                  website visitors.
               </p>
               <p>
                  External hosting is used for the purpose of secure, fast and
                  reliable provision of our website and in this context serves
                  to fulfill the contract with our potential and existing
                  customers.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The legal basis for the processing is Art.&nbsp;6 para.&nbsp;1
                  lit.&nbsp;a, b and f GDPR, as well as &sect;&nbsp;25
                  para.&nbsp;1 TTDSG, insofar as consent includes the storage of
                  cookies or access to information in the terminal device of the
                  website visitor or user within the meaning of the TTDSG.

                  The processing of personal data always requires a legal basis.
                  The GDPR provides the following options in Art.&nbsp;6
                  para.&nbsp;1 sentence&nbsp;1:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     The data subject has given their consent to the processing
                     of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
                     to which the data subject is party or in order to take
                     steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering
                     into a contract.

                  <li>
                     The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
                     obligation to which the controller is subject.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital
                     interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     Processing is necessary for the performance of a task
                     carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
                     official authority vested in the controller.

                  <li>
                     Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                     interests pursued by the controller(s) or by a third party,
                     except where such interests are overridden by the interests
                     or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
                     which require protection of personal data, in particular
