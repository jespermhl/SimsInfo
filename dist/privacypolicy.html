        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This website is operated by: Jesper Mahel</p>
<p>It is very important to us to handle our website visitors' data confidentially and to protect it in the best possible way. For this reason, we make every effort to meet the requirements of the GDPR.</p>
<p>Below we explain how we process your data on our website. We use language that is as clear and transparent as possible so that you really understand what happens to your data.</p>
<h2>2. General Information</h2>
<p><strong>2.1 Processing of personal data and other terms</strong></p>
<p>Data protection applies to the processing of personal data. Personal data means all data with which you can be personally identified. This is, for example, the IP address of the device (PC, laptop, smartphone, etc.) you are currently sitting in front of. Such data is processed when 'something happens to it'. Here, for example, the IP is transmitted from the browser to our provider and automatically stored there. This is then a processing (according to Art. 4 No. 2 GDPR) of personal data (according to Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR).</p>
<p>These and other legal definitions can be found in Art. 4 GDPR.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 Applicable regulations/laws - GDPR, BDSG and TTDSG</strong></p>
<p>The scope of data protection is regulated by law. In this case, these are the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) as a European regulation and the BDSG (Federal Data Protection Act) as a national law.</p>
<p>In addition, the TTDSG supplements the provisions of the GDPR as far as the use of cookies is concerned.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 The person in charge</strong></p>
<p>The controller within the meaning of the GDPR is responsible for data processing on this website. This is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.</p>
<p>You can reach the person responsible at:</p>
<p><em>Postal adress:</em><br/>
Jesper Mahel<br/>
Wacholderberg 33<br/>
35583 Wetzlar<br/>
Germany</p>
<p><em>Email adress:</em> jesper@simsinfohub.com</p>
<p><strong>2.4 How data is generally processed on this website</strong></p>
<p>As we have already established, some data (e.g. IP address) is collected automatically. This data is mainly required for the technical provision of the website. If we also use personal data or collect other data, we will inform you of this or ask for your consent.</p>
<p>You consciously provide us with other personal data.</p>
<p>You will find detailed information on this below.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Your rights</strong></p>
<p>The GDPR provides you with comprehensive rights. These include, for example, free information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You can also request the rectification, blocking or erasure of this data or lodge a complaint with the competent data protection supervisory authority. You can revoke your consent at any time.</p>
<p>You can find out what these rights look like in detail and how to exercise them in the last section of this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>2.6 Data protection - Our point of view</strong></p>
<p>Data protection is more than just a chore for us! Personal data has great value and careful handling of this data should be a matter of course in our digitalized world. As a website visitor, you should also be able to decide for yourself what "happens" to your data, when and by whom. That is why we are committed to complying with all legal regulations, only collect the data that is necessary for us and, of course, treat it confidentially.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 Forwarding and deletion</strong></p>
<p>The transfer and deletion of data are also important and sensitive issues. We would therefore like to briefly inform you in advance about our general approach to this.</p>
<p>Data will only be passed on on the basis of a legal basis and only if this is unavoidable. This may be the case in particular if it is a so-called processor and an order processing contract has been concluded in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.</p>
<p>We delete your data when the purpose and legal basis for processing no longer apply and the deletion does not conflict with any other legal obligations. Art. 17 GDPR also provides a 'good' overview of this.</p>
<p>For further information, please refer to this privacy policy and contact the person responsible if you have any specific questions.</p>
<p><strong>2.8 Hosting</strong></p>
<p>This website is hosted externally. The personal data collected on this website is stored on the host's servers. This includes the automatically collected and stored log files (see below for more details), as well as all other data provided by website visitors.</p>
<p>External hosting is used for the purpose of secure, fast and reliable provision of our website and in this context serves to fulfill the contract with our potential and existing customers.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, b and f GDPR, as well as § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the terminal device of the website visitor or user within the meaning of the TTDSG.</p>
<p>Our hoster only processes data that is required to fulfill its performance obligation and acts as our processor, i.e. it is subject to our instructions.</p>
<p>We use the following hoster:</p>
<p>Netlify<br/>
Netlify Inc.<br/>
2325 3rd Street, Suite 296<br/>
San Francisco, CA 94107<br/>
United States<br/>

<a class="icon-link" href="https://www.netlify.com/privacy/">https://www.netlify.com/privacy/<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></p>
<p><strong>2.9 Legal basis</strong></p>
<p>The processing of personal data always requires a legal basis. The GDPR provides the following options in Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
<li>Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li>
<li>The processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject.</li>
<li>Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.</li>
<li>Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</li>
<li>Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller(s) or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we will provide you with the specific legal basis for the respective processing.</p>
<h2>3. What happens on our website</h2>
<p>When you visit our website, we process your personal data.</p>
<p>We use SSL or TLS encryption to protect this data in the best possible way against unauthorized access by third parties. You can recognize this encrypted connection by the https:// or lock symbol in the address bar of your browser.</p>
<p>Below you can find out what data is collected when you visit our website, for what purpose this is done and on what legal basis.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Data collection when accessing the website</strong></p>
<p>When you visit the website, information is automatically stored in so-called server log files. This is the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser type and browser version</li>
<li>Operating system used</li>
<li>Referrer URL</li>
<li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
<li>Time of the server request</li>
<li>IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is temporarily required in order to be able to display our website to you permanently and without any problems. In particular, this data is used for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>System security of the website</li>
<li>System stability of the website</li>
<li>Troubleshooting on the website</li>
<li>Establishing a connection to the website</li>
<li>Presentation of the website</li>
</ul>
<p>Data processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR and is based on our legitimate interest in the processing of this data, in particular our interest in the functionality of the website and its security.</p>
<p>Where possible, this data is stored in pseudonymized form and deleted once the respective purpose has been achieved.</p>
<p>If the server log files make it possible to identify the data subject, the data is stored for a maximum period of 14 days. An exception is made if a security-relevant event occurs. In this case, the server log files are stored until the security-relevant event has been resolved and finally clarified.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no merging with other data takes place.</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Cookies</strong></p>
<p><em>General information</em></p>
<p>This website uses so-called cookies. This is a data record, information that is stored in the browser of your end device and is related to our website.</p>

<p>However, we must point out that a comprehensive blocking/deletion of cookies can lead to impairments in the use of the website.</p>
<p><em>Technically necessary cookies</em></p>
<p>We use technically necessary cookies on this website to ensure that our website functions correctly and in accordance with the applicable laws. They help to make the website user-friendly. Some functions of our website cannot be displayed without the use of technically necessary cookies The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b, c and/or f GDPR, depending on the individual case.</p>
<p>Technically not necessary cookies</p>
<p>We don't use cookies on our website that are not technically necessary.</p>
<p><strong>3.3 Third-party content</strong></p>
<p><em>jsdelivr.com-CDN</em></p>
<p>We use <a class="icon-link" href="https://jsdelivr.com/">jsdelivr.com<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> on our website. jsdelivr.com is a tool to load content, especially large files, quickly and optimally, even at high load peaks. This service is offered by ProspectOne, Królewska 65A/1, 30-081, Kraków, Poland.</p>
<p>With the help of jsdelivr.com, it is possible to deliver content, especially large files, quickly and optimally, even at high load peaks. Depending on the function of jsdelivr, different personal data is processed here. In order to provide this service, your browser can send personal data to jsdelivr.com. jsdelivr can therefore collect and store user data such as IP address, browser type, browser version, which website is loaded or the time and date of the page visit. The privacy policy of jsdelivr.com expressly states that the company does not use cookies or other tracking services. jsDelivr has servers distributed in different countries and your data may also be stored outside the European Economic Area. jsDelivr retains personal data processed on our behalf for as long as necessary to provide the services offered, to comply with legal obligations, to resolve disputes and to enforce the agreements.</p>
<p>You always have the right to information, correction and deletion of your personal data. If you have any questions, you can also contact the person responsible at jsdelivr.com at any time.</p>
<p>If you want to prevent this data transmission, you can install a JavaScript blocker (see for example <a class="icon-link" href="https://noscript.net/">https://noscript.net/<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a> ). Please note, however, that this will mean that the website can no longer offer the usual service.</p>
<p>We also have a legitimate interest in using jsdelivr.com-CDN to optimize our online service and make it more secure. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interests).</p>
<p>Further information on data processing by the jsDelivr software service can be found in the company's privacy policy at <a class="icon-link" href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net">https://www.jsdelivr.com/terms/privacy-policy-jsdelivr-net<i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></p>
<h2>4. What else is important</h2>
<p>Finally, we would like to inform you in detail about your rights and how you will be informed about changes to data protection requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Your rights in detail</strong></p>
<p><em>Right to information in accordance with Art. 15 GDPR</em></p>
<p>You can request information about whether your personal data is being processed. If this is the case, you can request further information on the type and manner of processing. A detailed list can be found in Art. 15 para. 1 lit. a to h GDPR.</p>
<p><em>Right to rectification in accordance with Art. 16 GDPR</em></p>
<p>This right includes the correction of incorrect data and the completion of incomplete personal data.</p>
<p><em>Right to erasure in accordance with Art. 17 GDPR</em></p>
<p>This so-called 'right to be forgotten' gives you the right, under certain conditions, to request the deletion of personal data by the controller. This is generally the case if the purpose of the data processing no longer applies, if consent has been withdrawn or the initial processing took place without a legal basis. A detailed list of reasons can be found in Art. 17 para. 1 lit. a to f GDPR. This "right to be forgotten" also corresponds to the obligation of the controller under Art. 17 para. 2 GDPR to take reasonable measures to bring about the general erasure of the data.</p>
<p><em>Right to restriction of processing in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR</em></p>
<p>This right is subject to the conditions set out in Art. 18 para. 1 lit. a to d GDPR.</p>
<p><em>Right to data portability pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR</em></p>
<p>This regulates the basic right to receive your own data in a commonly used form and to transfer it to another controller. However, this only applies to data processed on the basis of consent or a contract in accordance with Art. 20 para. 1 lit. a and b and insofar as this is technically feasible.</p>
<p><em>Right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR</em></p>
<p>In principle, you can object to the processing of your personal data. This applies in particular if your interest in objecting outweighs the legitimate interest of the controller in the processing and if the processing relates to direct marketing and/or profiling.</p>
<p><em>Right to "individual decision-making" pursuant to Art. 22 GDPR</em></p>
<p>In principle, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing (including profiling) which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. However, this right is also subject to restrictions and additions in Art. 22 para. 2 and 4 GDPR.</p>
<p><em>Additional rights</em></p>
<p>The GDPR includes comprehensive rights to inform third parties whether or how you have asserted rights under Art. 16, 17, 18 GDPR. However, this is only possible or feasible with reasonable effort.</p>
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention once again to your right to withdraw your consent in accordance with Art. 7 para. 3 GDPR. However, this does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out up to that point.</p>
<p>We would also like to draw your attention to your rights under §§ 32 ff. BDSG, which, however, are largely congruent with the rights just described.</p>
<p><em>Right to lodge a complaint pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR</em></p>
<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates this regulation.</p>
<h2>5. What if the GDPR is abolished tomorrow or other changes take place?</h2>
<p>The current status of this data protection declaration is 26.05.2024. From time to time it is necessary to adapt the content of the data protection declaration in order to react to actual and legal changes. We therefore reserve the right to amend this privacy policy at any time. We will publish the amended version in the same place and recommend that you read the privacy policy regularly.</p>
