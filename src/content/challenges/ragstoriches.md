        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        There are some mandatory steps, that you'll have to
        complete before completing the goals. More information
        is provided below.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="card mt-3">
    <div class="card-body">
        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>
            You must complete the mandatory steps, before you can
            get a job, build your home, build a garden and get a
            job.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can't use cheats, besides resetting your Sim,
            take away money or to move objects.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can't get a job before you have completed the
            mandatory steps. You will have to use the things
            listed below.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your spouse is not allowed to work until they have
            completed the mandatory steps either.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can't place anything on your Sims lot besides
            objects that you can put in your Sims inventory.
        </li>
        <li>
            You are not allowed to place items outside the walls
            of your home before you finish the Mandatory Steps
            for Building a Garden.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before you own a bed, you have to use public places
            like park benches or ottomans in libraries to sleep.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can't place beds on public lots. Once your
            friendly bar is full with a Sim, you can sleep at
            their house once a week, as soon as you have your own
            bed. You must count the days and on the seventh day
            you can stay with them again. While you're at their
            home for that one night you can make as many meals as
            you like but you can only take one plate with you.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>If you have outdoor retreat:</i> You can place
            tents with your own money but not on your home lot.
        </li>
        <li>
            To get food, you can rummage, garden plants in public
            places or cook on outdoor barbecues until you have
            built your home.
        </li>
        <li>
            While you can add other Sims besides your spouse and
            kids, they can't earn money with hobbies nor can they
            work in any way.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your lifespan can be set to anything you would like
            or you could even turn aging off completely.
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>If you have City Living:</i> You can use
            apartments, but you will have to remove everything
            and you will have to work your way up to a penthouse
            to complete the garden goal.
