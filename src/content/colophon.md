## Colophon

This website is built using standard [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to ensure a clean and accessible structure that functions well across all modern browsers. The design and responsiveness of the site are powered by the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework, which provides a robust foundation with pre-designed components and utilities, making the site both visually appealing and mobile-friendly. The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), a platform known for its reliability, speed, and seamless continuous deployment capabilities. All development is carried out using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a versatile and powerful code editor that enhances productivity with its extensive plugin support and integrated development environment features. The icons used on the site are from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com), an open-source library that perfectly complements the Bootstrap framework with a consistent and polished appearance. Our domain is registered with [Checkdomain](https://www.checkdomain.de/?pid=503e9945), a service that ensures secure and reliable domain management. Additionally, a [custom self-made compiler](https://www.github.com/k1nsej/simsinfo) is utilized during the development process, tailored specifically to optimize performance and meet the unique needs of this project.
